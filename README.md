Unified Course Registration Interface (UCRI)üóíÔ∏è

Welcome! this is my first official project that I'm proud to share!

This was a colaborative proyect from college, the proyect consisted in a unified system that provides teachers access to register courses with their respective clasrooms and time schedules. 

The main goal was to portray our habilites with basic mysql database management, including DML and DDL, all with a java based interface that allowed the user to manage the database itself.
